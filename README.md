Implement thorough input validation and use parameterized queries.
Follow the least privilege principle for database user permissions.
Deploy a WAF to monitor and block SQL injection attempts.
Keep software updated with security patches.
Provide security training for personnel.
Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
Configure servers securely.
